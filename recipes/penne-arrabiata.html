<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>½ cup olive oil, divided</li>
  <li>6 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
  <li>1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil</li>
  <li>½ cup tomato sauce</li>
  <li>1 bunch fresh basil, chopped</li>
  <li>1 (12 ounce) package dried penne pasta</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>

  <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon pepper</li>
  <li>1 pound thin chicken breast cutlets</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Heat 1/4 cup of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the
    garlic, and saute for a few minutes. Sprinkle in the red pepper flakes, and
    saute for another minute. Pour in the diced tomatoes and tomato sauce, and
    add the basil. Simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  </li>
  <li>
    Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne
    pasta, and cook for 8 minutes, or until tender. Drain.
  </li>
  <li>
    In a small bowl, whisk eggs with a fork. Place bread crumbs in a separate
    bowl. Stir the garlic powder, salt and pepper into the bread crumbs. Dip
    chicken cutlets into the egg, then press into the bread crumbs until
    completely coated.
  </li>
  <li>
    Heat remaining olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry chicken
    for about 5 minutes per side, or until the coating is a nice dark brown
    color.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remove chicken, and cut into slices. Toss the chicken slices into the sauce,
    and simmer for about 10 minutes. Stir in the cooked penne, simmer for a few
    more minutes to soak up the flavor, then serve.
